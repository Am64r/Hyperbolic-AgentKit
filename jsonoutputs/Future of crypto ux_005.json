So if you want to get in touch there, I think my uh handle's up here at the front. Uh, so that's my Twitter handle, pumpernikhil. Uh, so in this case that's probably the easiest way to get in touch. And then if you're interested in like staking in our system, running an operator or something like that, we are on aggregator layers like Dashboard and all of those things. So that's probably the easiest way to go and take a look and be able to stake with one of the operators that is in our network or, you know, spin up your own operator. And, if you're interested in that feel free to reach out and, of course, we can get you added to our Telegram group of operators."
