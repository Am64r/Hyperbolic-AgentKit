    "content": "I have a yeah I have a quite like a zoomed out question that I think will close this out just kinda zooming all the way out like what do you what do you think is our moat like you know you mentioned that you're you're already good at you know a lot of the things that AI is good at and I think a lot of people are facing very similar phenomenon or pattern right now where like they're finding that AI is increasingly good at what they're good at whether it's driving a truck or it's writing or it's you know deriving chemicals in a in a or reading x-rays or what have you right what do you think in general is our moat"
  },

    "speaker": "Guest",
    "content": "I would say our moat is so the first thing I said is capital um so like before the AI explosion happens go get some fucking money uh so that's that's number one um number two I would say you're welcome you're welcome uh number two I would say um more and more writing is being devalued and speaking is being upvalued So the more that you uh focus on charisma relationships communication those things are gonna matter more and more in a post AI world because those are the things that AIs are not gonna be able to do as well Right so AI is obviously you know if you listen to um you know OpenAI advanced voice mode Obviously in a narrow sense it is very charismatic right has this perfect lilting voice it can sing it can you know it has this you know sultry whisper it can you know whatever pronounce everything perfectly never says ums or ahs or whatever uh never says whatever or whatever when it's giving a response but it doesn't get invited to parties and you do and like the the the thing to remember is that you know who has all the resources who has all the capital in the world the answer is other humans at least for the foreseeable future and those other humans do not want to hang out with ChatGPT advanced voice mode they want to hang out with you and so your job then is to be somebody who those humans want to hang out with and so that the I think what ends up being elevated more and more is relationship skills communication skills and there's the other thing to understand is that okay now you have a legion of AIs available to you right what are you gonna do with that legion of AIs can you even come up with something to do are you able to actually orchestrate those AIs and manage them which means that the really important skill for human beings to use all the capital that you've acquired because what does that capital buy you it buys you intelligence Once you have a lot of intelligence underneath you what can you do with it the answer is whatever your organizational and management skills and communication skills allow you to do with it So in the same way okay you've got this great you've got this amazing AI at your fingertips right You've got Cloud you've got GPT4 you've got O1 um can you actually tell it what you want because if you can tell it what you want it will do it but if you cannot explain what you want then it's not it you're gonna think that oh this AI is stupid it can't do what I want No no no the the one who is failing to accomplish the task is you not the AI Exactly And multiple languages And multiple languages yeah exactly can speak any language anytime it wants to can recite poetry off just pure memory um but"

    "content": "Yeah So you're saying to invest resources into your teams or your organizational ability the the actual people invest resources into their ability to write proper prompts and for you on your own as well"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Guest",
    "content": "prompting is a narrow way to describe it I would say and here's the thing we're gonna move past prompting because prompting is like a you know prompting in general it's like oh well there's all these like little secret sauce you tell it to think step by step and you know give it three examples and do this and do that you know tell it nicely tell you're gonna pay it 20 bucks if it gives you the right answer all okay th- this is like prompting techniques right and these are all kind of weird little tricks of the trade Uh this will go away eventually we'll just like bake this stuff into the pipeline of how you interact with the LLM so you don't have to know any of that um the thing that won't go away is communication skills Right no matter how smart the AI is you will still need to tell it like for example you know um like my um uh friend of mine was uh I was watching them interact with the AI and they were saying like oh you know I I want a website you know have this AI create a website for for them and they were like hey you know I want you to create a home page for me um that says this this and this and the AI you know just you know spits out some home page and they're like uh you know I don't really like it um you know make it uh you know make it make it make it look nicer you know I'm like okay that's you don't know how to explain what you want right like you have some idea in your head of what you want but you don't actually know how to describe what you want and to be clear that would be true if you were talking to an engineer if you hired an engineer and you said you know please make this home page better you said okay how do you want me to make it better It's like make it nicer but w- what what what the what what does that you mean make it nicer right So your ability to communicate what you want and just be able to have the theory of mind to understand another person trying to understand your instructions right That is basically just communication skills that's management skills Those skills will be true no matter how prompting changes You will always need those skills in order to interact with AIs in order to interface with other intelligences so your ability to cultivate that skill It's the same skill that managers have right what is a manager's job A manager's job is to understand what their reports are doing and to communicate those reports clear goals and instructions and monitor their progress right That's the basic loop of what a manager does everybody is going to need those skills because we are all going to have many many agents working for us And now look the parts of a manager that you want us to do is the touchy-feely shit right You wanna be like hey let's you know small talk how's your kids are you feeling burnt out blah blah blah like you'll never need to ask your agents that but you will need to ask them how's it coming along what's your progress what are your blockers what do you need me to do in order to get you know uh this thing is not quite what I want I want to do more of this right can you actually do all of that and if you can't then you could have the same number of AIs working for you and you're not gonna get the same amount of work out of them as somebody who's better at that fundamental set of skills Exactly"

    "content": "As a as an entrepreneur for six years I'm wholeheartedly excited to have an army of AI agents because of my capital base that I've built up over the last six years and put that to use to just amplify the work cuz humans are great and we have a great team here at The Rollup of about 10 now nine or 10 fully bootstrapped we've Rob and I've just done it on our own it's been a it's been a wild four years but I mean taking that to like 20 and having eight of them be agents or something like that would just be I mean the like"

    "content": "Oh my goodness So Rob to answer your question the mode is speaking charisma it's it it's really communication skills in the in the person to to person interaction where AI can you know can't kind of step in and intervene and be as good as us there whereas in writing and in art and design and these things those people are kind of cooked"

    "content": "That's right The other thing I'd say is discipline like no amount of AIs are gonna make you more disciplined no amount of AIs are gonna make you less greedy no amount of AIs are gonna make you more patient um so all that stuff of like you know cultivating your own virtue as a human being that stuff you are on your own AIs are not gonna help you um and if you're impatient if you're greedy if you're not actually uh long-term focused um or if you're just you know not even receptive to feedback you've got too much of an ego um you know you can use an AI anytime you want to like you know Andy how many times have you said look here's the business plan of The Rollup I'm gonna go submit this business plan to Cloud and ask it wha- what do you think are the big things I'm missing that I could be doing better to get an extra 50 percent of growth in The Rollup um how many times have you asked Cloud that"

    "speaker": "Andy",

    "speaker": "Guest",
    "content": "But you have to also have the humility You have to have the humility right The reality is that most people won't even ask yeah Most people won't even ask most people are like look of course I'm doing the right thing like oh yeah I should I want to you know 50 agents to help me build a fucking food truck or you know whatever whatever is the thing they wanna do right and th- their ability to actually take that intelligence Exactly"
