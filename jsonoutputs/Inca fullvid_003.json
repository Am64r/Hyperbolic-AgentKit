    "content": "that one is because your market cap is smaller you'll have higher volatility and because you have higher volatility typically you know you have to give a higher inflation rates of your tokens to compensate for the inventory risk that all the stickers will have right So typically you know cosmos chains give out twenty to fifty percent annual inflation rate which is you know really really high Uh but if you can utilize this concept of dual staking which is you know effectively staking Ethereum and Inco um then essentially you can uh lower the inflation rate because etherum market cap arguably is going to be more stable less volatile the second point is yeah because your market cap is also lower your security is also much lower to begin with right Um so this is where you know with dual staking you could also leverage the uh uh economic security of of either of eth etherealth stakers uh you can essentially increase your overall security uh through dual staking Um in terms of architecture this is definitely still I would say a very open ended uh exploration um I personally haven't quite seen many teams uh being able to you know completely finish this in in in terms of production ready architecture but there has definitely been a couple of explorations Uh for ex for example like I I can maybe share little bit more about what we've considered um So you know when you run uh a customer chain uh like like we do here what you could do effectively to uh get this economic from se security economic security from etherum is to customize your L1 nodes to monitor all the states on etherum and so from there you could also inject So you can basically uh observe the additional uh economy stake on eth and inject that economy stake directly into your staking module on the cosmos cosmos side And so you could either do it I would say through some kind of voting module uh uh within the cosmos nodes or maybe through something like a vote extension So uh I I'm not sure if you have heard of vote extension Andy and Robbie If not I can quickly uh explain that"

    "content": "Yeah um unfamiliar Please uh i- if you don't mind"

    "speaker": "Remi",
    "content": "Yeah fo- fo- from uh high level vote extension is essentially the ability for every single validator to run a sidecar and this sidecar basically can collect any arbitrary information So um I think some folks uh we've seen around like for example skip what they do collect is like for example the price of bitcoin ethereum and then they basically inject in oracle pricing through this sidecar uh what we could do here is for example monitor the voting power or the stake amount stake eth um on ethereum and essentially every single validator uh during the consensus process can inject arbitrary data and you can also write custom logic to uh basically uh verify that you know the attestated uh values are the same And from there you can change the state machine basically of cosmos So it it's just a very convenient way to uh add additional external information into a blockchain system uh via the consensus And uh so I I would say that's that's a way that we can potentially use uh for for this you know voting power um fo- fo- for calculating the new voting power basically within this entire system"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Andy",
    "content": "Yup Got it That makes sense And so this is something that I again or excuse me This is something that Ethereum validators would run as a sidecar and then they would also have the ability to implement this into the AVSs that they secure um via restaking So actually you know the This is something that the the Inco L1 validators will run"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "Got it Right Okay Got it Um i- I'm wondering just that like you know a lot of the the purpose functionality of of the Inco L1 seems to be uh uh encryption decryption and and more cryptographic security me- measures And so how how should we think about the way to balance crypto crypto- cryptographic security ha- handling on the L1 and then crypto economic security under li- like underneath the L1"

  {
    "speaker": "Remi",
    "content": "That's a very good question So today the reality is with FHE um verifiable FHE is quite inefficient and so there has been research uh around how you do like uh let's say like uh like a snark proof of a FHE compute right Uh the most costly step is around bootstrapping and so that research basically uh came out with the results saying that a single bootstrap takes twenty minutes to prove today and uh so we're still quite far away I would say to be able to do fully verifiable FHE and so the second best option here is re- via consensus So one property that you have with FHE that's interesting is that the compute is deterministic So this is where every single node that does the same compute can also arrive at the same conclusion and via consensus they can disagree or agree with each other's uh answers So this is how our L1 is uh basically uh computing and also basically agreeing on the end results Now what's actually slashable in that context is not necessarily the uh compute results I I guess you could do something intersubjective here uh but if you want uh something more uh objective then probably you will happen I would say later on when you can actually do you know some kind of ZK FHE uh Yeah I I I would say it will probably take some time Uh but in the context of cosmos what is slashable is the concept of double signing So if the validators you know attest to different results uh then that's you can actually catch them on that and then on ethereum you could actually pass in let's say this double signing signatures and then slash them right So that's that's doable and objective today Uh the FHE compute side I would say will probably take a bit more time uh as of now So the second best option is I would say yeah consensus and using maybe uh like a more of a social way of slashing around in- intersubjective um the intersubjective slashing concepts Yep Makes sense Thanks So so you get like the cryptographic guarantees of ZKA uh MPTC and FHE and then you also simultaneously get this crypto economic security from Ethereum So like why is this not something that or from EigenLayer from re-staked assets like wh- why isn't everybody building in this way where you get both levels of up of security Like it it seems like the holy grail"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Remi",
    "content": "So so yeah just to clarify So today what we're utilizing is economic security with consensus We're not doing cryptographic security uh because like I said verifiable FHE is still sometime away Um but it is feasible and this is probably more of a long term goal What you could prove cryptographically and sla- that's slashable is double signing So that's outside of the cryptography this is more of a cosmos thing that that actually does work uh What's interesting is uh Yeah we- we- we thought about some you know potential interesting ways to uh yeah I guess without getting too much into the weeds you know some folks ha- have also been working on this idea of like ZK IBC uh you know ho- ho- how do you prove you know cosmos states um or verify cosmos states on chain on ethereum and so there could be also slashing mechanism uh in that sense uh that we're still exploring um but yeah definitely a super interesting area uh for sure Cool Thanks"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Remi",
    "content": "Uh so yeah I guess onto the use cases So what can you do with you know FHE and what we're building here Um e- essentially you can think of an augmentation of existing EVMs and now you can build new use cases across gaming asset management DeFi and infra that wouldn't be possible ot- otherwise right uh Couple of examples So imagine building a confidential ERC20 where you know Bob sends money to Alice uh the co- the balance here is confidential So in solidity it just the mapping of address to you wins for your balance It's an encrypted integer and when you do a confidential transfer essentially you are doing uh FHE comparison you know do you have enough balance and then you also basically add a hidden amount to the recipient's balance which could be zero or the actual you know value here Uh so essentially"
