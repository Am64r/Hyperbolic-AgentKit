  },
  {
    "speaker": "Andy",
    "content": "Yeah um I think order flow is really like how do you and order order flow sources and options is like uh order flow tends to originate from users uh so this tends to be like high level apps this tends to be like Uniswap that's the source of order flow um and then these options are like how do you option off this order flow uh I'm not a big fan of this idea that we've made MEV like an an inevitable component uh rather than a bug to like fix um because why does lots of MEV exist Well it exists because you sign over an execution trace not ever state update like and so I mean if you come from computer science you will know that like depending on how you interleave your database updates they will result in there like um or depending on how you execution"

  {
    "speaker": "Andy",
    "content": "Sorry could you just define an execution trace too"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Guest",
    "content": "Oh yeah sorry um so an execution trace is think of it as like a recipe like um uh smart contact on Ethereum is an execution trace You go first do this then do this like two plus two make the crypto kitty blue send it somewhere right like that's it's a true it's like you go step by step and you execute it uh that way uh and you must know exactly which compute you want to run uh this is actually kind of difficult and you have to a number of bugs stem from this problem that like you define the that like these are execution traces And what actually happens when a user sends a transaction on Ethereum they don't sign over a specific state update they sign over an execution trace so they're like This is my entry point and this contract is a a is allowed to like run its individual steps and and I get some state afterwards like you can simulate it and you kind of know what kind of state you're getting but you don't get it in protocol guarantee Whereas with an intent with a generalized intent you sign over the specific future state and then you don't care right whether there's like one like that there's like a ZK proof involved or that there's it's going by an end to compute the eventual state this is by the way the really big unlock for Anoma intents which is you sign over state update you do not sign over execution traces um because again if you sign over an execution trace you must kind of know which other counterparties interacting with because you need to call them in your execution trace so they must be typed in Whereas in Anoma you can go well I have A for B someone that gives me the other side of the thing yeah that's settleable And then so in protocol you just check Do uh did did the did the updates adhere to the sign state updates as in like other state updates uh like fulfilled or violated and if it's violated you reject the update um So this is uh the way I think of execute the way to think of execution traces um and so a lot of teams have started like designing around Well we have all this order flow that's really an execution trace that I can interleave in various ways uh let's try to monetize this by like auctioning off the ability to fuck ordinary users um This is a good idea I'm not sure um like I no one likes the fact that sitting on the desk with Robinhood like I don't know um It seems bad um So and Anoma doesn't provide this Anoma just provides and this is a little bit I think the problem with this map like Honestly the right answer to this problem is like the background the like light back uh black background color should just be Anoma colored because Anoma provides like hooks into all these different components It's not like It's not just a simple one thing like it's not just selling your order flow It's not just like providing you an execution environment or consensus system it's like How do you get a sort of like fully fledged operating system that you can deploy on many different settlement layers um and then how do you have the infrastructure to connect all these things and then how can solvers read this data compute some sort of like transactions and settle them then wherever the users want to settle them um And so for example like solvers can also be used for cost station here um because I can have an intent that says this is only valid in a month from now And if in a month from now you claim it like you set you execute this you can claim I don't know 0.01 ETH Um right and so that means that now I'm just pricing data availability costs on like does someone is someone willing to keep around my intent for one month in exchange for 0.01 ETH um And so I Anoma provides this kind of orchestration um but again it's like people always think of these systems as like as tokens as like oh like I must have like this is my priced pony and like you must write my priced pony kind of somewhere um and I charge you fees for this like Anoma isn't Anoma's just like There's infrastructure and you can free to use it please go ahead like use it right It's not like there's no Anoma chain you must interact with um or like there's a network specific RPC you must talk to um"
