    "content": "So so so to put that in context um DeFi couldn't exist with just Bitcoin you know So first the Ethereum and the EVM had to come along And then even if you just had the EVM in isolation you still can't have DeFi So the ICO boom kind of had to happen because that created on-chain assets for the first time And you needed on-chain assets So and then even something like something like yield primitives like yearn etc couldn't exist Because you first needed some native yield So you needed automated market makers You needed money markets you know Uniswap Compound Aave etc When those existed now you can start you know doing aggregators um you can start doing derivatives So a lot of those concepts that came later um um something like um GMX comes to mind You you know all all of these things were only possible because of the previous iteration But those iterations are unlocked either via some kind of social event like ICOs or some kind of technological breakthrough like the EVM Um it's not necessarily only technology It's not necessarily only social but there's a mix of it that kinda have to happen And I think right now we're not seeing a lot of new stuff because we're waiting for that next technology leap um And I think o- o- obviously I'm biased with the stuff we're doing at Sonic So anyone listening to this I have clear bias Don't take this as gospel um but you know a lot of the things we're doing there in terms of um removing gas as a barrier um removing um just cryptography private public key for accounts as a barrier um incentivizing projects um and then of course the the just latent throughput of the chain They make these things these this next wave possible Um and I'm I'm going to try and show that with some of the the new DeFi dapps I'm launching as well Um but again to use an example you know If you if you look at YouTube or or Twitch or any of these streaming platforms today They they it would be completely impossible for them to have existed in the 1990s internet um what it is today would have been even impossible in the in the early 2000s internet You know It first had to evolve sort of dial-up ISDN ADSL fiber interconnected with seacom cables etc to get it to the point where it is today where it can handle the scale And I mean today you know Google Yahoo whatever um YouTube etc those are some of the biggest businesses in the world but they it was impossible for them to exist without those technological leaps first So that next leap I think is an important thing um Then from from sort of the the social aspect you know A lot of a lot of the old-school DeFi fun for me personally came not from so much the yield farming but from playing with new stuff new primitives new things to interact with new things to explore and I think largely new things to learn um a- a- and today that's not really the case you know Li- like all of ev- everything that's happening now it's just maybe a different spin but mostly copy and paste of stuff we've already seen So I I I I think there's I think there's definitely sort of DeFi fatigue And and you can see that with people being more excited about you know meme coins or whatever uh I I I mean Ye- yeah man twenty seve- t- twenty seventeen twenty eighteen if someone launched a meme coin like the community would have completely vilified them you know Li- like it would have been everything against all of us stood for back then as pure technologists But at the same time we need to accept that this industry has changed drastically There are a lot more non-technical participants than they're used to be um and a lot more greed uh Not necessarily saying that's a bad thing um each to his own you know I'm I'm I'm sure I I do not believe the people that get excited about meme coins are the same demographic as people that get excited about DeFi apps you know So so I don't particularly think there's sort of a And and an argument I had sort of original early twenty twenty one with all of these pointless farms was that they're stealing uh capital and investment from projects that are actually trying to build real stuff um and I think it might have been a little bit more true back then but nowadays I don't think that's true anymore because these same people that you know throw their life savings into the next I don't know something with a hat They they don't particularly care about you know DeFi apps And they would not have invested in that in any case They would have looked at it thought um that's complex I'm not gonna touch that um but funny picture I understand um which I guess is also bit of a natural evolution from ev- every NFTs really which if I look at it from that perspective it- it's really NFT without the technology you It's taking away another you know step that people actually had to go through Um so yeah I think market fatigue I think technology leap and I think um an entirely new demographic um that we need to kinda start accepting are you know in the in the Uh I'm hesitant to say community but you know I- i- in the in the sector as a whole um"

    "content": "Fair enough Do you think this progression into more of this like meme coin ape degen culture and is that taking us away from like you said you know back in twenty ten twenty seventeen they would have gotten vilified Do you think we're we're appeasing that that social demographic and we're moving further and further away from some of the true technologists are we losing them or or are we or now is there both demographics here"

    "content": "Um I I I I think it's probably a bit of both I I think the silliness of the sector would definitely drive away some people that would have otherwise you know probably contributed in some technological way Um but I I I I don't think that's a huge amount um I just think you know one of one of one of I think the silliest sort of crypto memes is the is the we're so early wait till retail gets here um retail's been here for the last three four years and they're the ones you know following into all of this stuff um So I think you know this is just this is what happens when you reach a certain momentum you you know I mean If if we look at traditional stocks it kinda went through the same iteration right Like it was originally like a lot more proper finance/ technologists that were excited about the potential technology of building the stock exchanges you know settlement engines clearing houses etcetera um but as it becomes more and more accessible you start getting more and more meme stocks and these kinds of things I I I was watching a fascinating documentary um I wanna credit the guy now YouTube something Yani something um about Bed Bath and Beyond you know and like him interviewing these investors I mean the company is bankrupt The the stocks have been wiped out And these guys are still convinced it's part of some kind of plan that they're gonna be reissued shares and there's some big behind-the-scenes acquisition with Gamestop and it's Watching that it's it's both sad and very eye-opening because like a lot of those people are in crypto as well And it makes me understand that You know back uh again g- going back to early DeFi like my my disclaimers and my medium articles and stuff were enough for the people interacting with it because they used to do research before touching stuff Towards the end of that cycle you know twenty twenty one twenty twenty two probably People weren't reading anything anymore They were just looking for a contract and throwing money at it And I realized that no amount of disclaimers or medium articles or anything was really going to prevent that anymore And that's also why I took a definitively little bit step back um And fast forward to now I think people people don't want to you know They they they want to gamble anyway Sorry I I I I I think I'm veering off of the original thing but but I think it really just comes down to there are a lot more participants Which is both good and bad um There's a lot more attention which is both good and bad um I I I I do feel like there has been a lack of new entrants and new ideas into this market but like I've said in the original question I think that is largely due to needing a next technological wave or social or regulatory or whatever it is um Maybe that's hopium You know Maybe maybe maybe we've chased away all of the technologists But we'll see We'll see That's that's for the future to decide right"

    "content": "Yeah I think like I mean I think w- we'll get into some of the Sonic stuff right and just the the thesis behind of extremely high throughput base layer Right Because ultimately a lot of the stuff that we were doing on Ethereum back in twenty twenty and twenty one became pretty quickly limited by the Ethereum L1 scaling capacity which is kinda led now to"
