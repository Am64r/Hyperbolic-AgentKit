    "content": "Yeah Yeah I think I generally agree that funds need to be focused and kill it in a space that you understand deeply um because you'll be better placed to make bets in a category that you really understand or you're really uniquely netwo- well networked in or you have some strategic value um and that is a differentiator so in a world where if every fund just looks like a an ETF of the space then yeah it's not really going to work right you're not going to make um returns that that anyone else couldn't just easily make That being said you're investment fund also has to reflect the maturity of the industry itself and um at the moment you know there's there are a lot of categories in crypto that have popped up where if you said you know in only focus on interoperability so I'm not going to touch you know stable coins but you have you know an opportunity to to invest in one because there there're you know let's say a couple years ago there there weren't that many um investment funds then you'd be doing your investors a disservice to stick to this ideological point and not participate in a good quality deal um that kind of is might maybe outside of the category that you want to focus on So uh let's say crypto VCs you know back in the day they could just kind of buy a bunch of Bitcoin and that was enough um then there was a phase where okay uh we're kind of in now where most crypto VCs are kind of just like index funds they're all sort of investing in the same shit you see the same names at every deal and um not that differentiated but increasingly here and there there's pockets of funds that are more focused and um that in another couple years that'll be the norm it won't be enough to to just be a generalist fund that the real money is in in uh you know above average returns is is going to be um in the hands of those who who can really dive deep Also as the size of the industry uh you know just gets bigger there was a time where it was just too small of a space to even focus too much on one one category We're still kinda there but um that's that's changing quickly so it's a you know um for us we we kind of were we were a a much leaner team we still are a lean team um we're we're sort of operating the- there was this phase before Mark Andreessen started you know Andreessen Horowitz um and well after he was done with his his uh operating ventures um there's like like a decade where he was just writing these 200K checks in seed and series A deals um I think Arthur is in a similar kind of phase where we're sort of like bootstrapping a fund um and writing these super angel quote unquote type checks in uh a variety of of fields and just kind of learning and and and understanding uh what are naturally going to be on the fly so we take a a category of time um when we first got started so it was November of 2022 uh if you look at some of the first maybe six months of deals that we did they were all focused on the staking space um staking infrastructure it was staking uh as it pertains to consumer applications it was um a major stable coin project um or I shouldn't call that it's really a synthetic dollar that um relies on this sorta sorta staking um narrative as well there was that was just our thing and uh we went deep and then you know after that we kind of pivoted once we we felt like we had kinda capped out and uh just been taking one theme at a time Now it seems a little bit bigger and we're we're expanding you kinda probably see it on our portfolio page it is chronological so you'll see like uh there was a focus originally that's now become a little broader um and um th- that is kind of basically a reflection of the fact that now we we do want to get exposure in all these different spaces and we'll double down when we find a category that's really exciting"

    "content": "Yeah um Cool man well a- as we kinda wrap up you know this has been this has been fascinating great conversation like maybe we do like a little bit of rapid fire you know fun here like little game where you know you you mentioned kinda the- these different time horizons and then a few different categories and so I'd love to kinda get your perspective on how sustainable some of these categories are you know Yeah i- if you could you know just rip like let's go 1 2 5 10 50 and 100 year maybe that's too many just let's just go let's just go 2 5 10 50 100 2 5 10 50 100 so five categories like which one do you think i- you know is a 2 year you know it'll it'll be well it'll go well for the next 2 years but then it'll it'll die off in 2 years which category do you think is going to survive for five which one's going to be around for 10 for 50 and then which categories going to survive for a 100 years"

    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "Yeah Well I think it it kinda just goes down the stack right like starting with the 100 years store value simplest concepts will last centuries gold lasted thousands of years you know Bitcoin we'll see at least a century um kinda working your way up smart contracts right that that concept like there might be evolutions and it might look different in the future but I think that's that's a multi-decade bet that that's sort of like the basis of how uh thing people transact in the future and then working your way up um from there the category we're excited about for the next like let's say 5 10 years is the intents space um that's like Yeah we'll we'll see what that does for uh interoperability but I think it could be game-changing we're we've started to do a few deals in that category um and the next couple years things like uh you know DeFi as it stands now DeFi is going to look very different um especially as uh some of the the notional dollars in the space dramatically increase um but um most of the consumer facing DeFi applications of today are not really business models that are going to last more than 2 to 5 years in their current form"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "Yeah um I think you know for us founders that we uh like to work with usually have a few traits and one they they don't they're not trying to build you know um a business model that is trying to do it in one uh part of crypto and just copy it over to another uh that tends to be an area where we might here and there write a check because it's there's upside opportunity but it's not those are not the projects we're going to double down and be your ally and tweet about you everyday and and uh back you as a uh a a game changer for humanity um those are the kind of deals we'd prefer to to invest in a good example uh would be Athena right that's one we feel like genuinely could it's an experiment like like everything in our space the entire space is a is an experiment but it generally could move the needle on how um money works in humanity some version of it the next evolution of it could uh and that's the kind of stuff we really like to back um the other thing I'd say is we we do a lot of extensive background checks on founders and integrity is the most important thing that we look at in a founder It's more important than intellect uh the ability to you know marshal resources it really is integrity so those are two things I'd say if you're a founder that's hit us up if you fit the bill on on those two fronts"
