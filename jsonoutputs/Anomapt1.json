Welcome back to the rollup uh today a conversation around intense privacy scaling Many of the topics that we've been covering on the channel So, I think that we'll have a fresh perspective today from Adrian Adrian I think we might have met or done a podcast in like 2020 or something It was so long ago um whether be it might have been at a conference um but definitely seen"

    "speaker": "Guest",
    "content": "No No People read way too much into this <noise>  uh so the the original story for this is really <noise> in 2017 I was at SF blockchain week Um and for some reason I think I was wearing red hoodie and I was the only like we were like 200 people there I was the only person with a red hoodie and then over time I just kept wearing red hoodies and at some point it started getting too warm So it's like okay red hoodies are like not happening anymore It's way too warm in these venues nowadays So it's like let's try the hair That's really the only story  um <noise> It worked tremendously well like for some reason no one has copied this Um I have no idea why I really didn't expect this to like last this long without other people try to go for other colors"

    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "Yeah <noise> So you mentioned kind of uh back I mean some years ago um in in San Francisco and just kind of your previous work with Tendermint uh one of the first core developers and then also working at the Web3 Foundation which Is that is that Polkadot? Is that Web3 Foundation?"

    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "Nice So how did you find Tendermint Polkadot? How did you get interested in kind of validating like like what was the light bulb moment for you where you were like okay like I'm gonna start developing in crypto? Did you have a previous dev background?"

    "speaker": "Guest",
    "content": "uh So I wrote my grad thesis on um <noise> center resistant e-voting uh back in 2016 um and in 2016 there was nothing right Like there was nothing available so I built it on Ethereum So wrote uh a couple of smart contracts there to and this really came from the idea of the Arab Spring and the Catalan independence movement and like what does it look like in a world where people can vote independent of central government right? Like that was sort of the basic thesis behind behind my grad thesis Um so built that along and like I mean in 2016 We were very few people We were very few people Um and so like a lot of these like cool ideas like PBFT sort of flowing around I came across the I don't actually remember exactly why but I came across the Tendermint paper the consensus paper during my research uh for the grad thesis Um and ended up really liking the paper It was like Sounds cool um <noise> Join the slack message Jay was like This looks dope Do you need help <noise> um and then joined Tendermint Like yeah I was like Do you need help in all the code we can Like this looks cool uh joined Tendermint back in Like like I think January 2017 um and then sort of started building from the ground up So I really started off in the Ethereum community then like went sort of peer consensus right down um towards fast finality And my basic thesis always has been that like it seems unlikely that there will be a single global security market um because I find the UN terrifying I think everyone that like wants more centralized governments they're all statists um and I think like you want to be sovereign right? Like you wanna have many levels of sovereignty and you want to have the ability to like pick your level of sovereignty and like be able to exit from these systems So I was never that a single consensus never appealed that much to me um because I think they're easily capturable no matter how decentralized they are Like if Bitcoin is the only thing out there in existence that seems just terrifying And I think like 99% of everyone of the industry agrees with this by the way Because I think no one here goes like should we have a really decentralized one world government Does that sound like a good idea to you? Like no one says yes to that Um so like it was always about like giving users choice having the ability to move assets around um having these very interoperable systems um Yeah then just built built up Tendermint from the ground up um started on the very first validator company's back in 2017 like end of 2017 Uh and like again people weren't around then really don't remember this but like people thought we were crazy Like proof of stake was not a thing that any reasonable person thought was going to work Um Everyone was very skeptical even PBFT was very skeptical Like everyone was like well maybe we should have like things like Kadena Nakamoto consensus these kinds of things  um and so I built up one of the very first validator companies because there's nothing around and um in that move I also moved to Switzerland <noise> um because I figured you know like where do you store hot keys with lots of money on them? Well the Swiss Alps historically seem like a very good place to do this Um Yeah I need a new place to live anyway because I was just pinging around It's like at some point you want to have at least like some closet where you can put things right Um so move to Switzerland we ran everything on physical hardware on the Alps um I think the only validator It was cool but also very annoying I now understand why AWS exists If your physical hardware like fun for six months and after that you're like fuck me actually I should have no impact on servers This was a terrible idea Um <noise>  No and then like from that also spiraled um <noise> and then really like this all ended up in Anoma um sort of because in the summer of 2020 um me and my two co-founders were pretty depressed on the state of crypto um because you know I mean everyone was like doing the same thing It's like well let's like copy these three smart contracts through this new thing And for some reason this is like going to make my parents want to like use these systems like going to advanced like some fundamental criteria um and so out of this came Anoma just really the idea that they um users had intents They didn't have transactions Like no one ever has a transaction unless you go to a store to buy some milk with Bitcoin because then like your Bitcoin transaction true That's a transaction but like the other side of the traders settled in the physical world So in the digital world pretty much everyone that wants like trade an asset or like I want to be part of this multi stake I wanna be part of this um public goods funding effort These are all intents They're not transactions They're not directly settled in consensus It made no sense to like dump all of these things in consensus because it was highly inefficient Um and so that was the first key inside The second key inside was like um you really need decentralized counterparty discovery So like how do you discover other people with whom to do things Like Uniswap like to Hayden's credit right? Uniswap is like the smartest way to do this on chain We have an AMM that just like the central counterparty for everything Uh This does not scale This does not like is very hard to generalize um It's super inefficient because we have to like dump all our intents for some reason in consensus Um but you need it some way Like you need some way to discover who are the other parties that I want to interact with um and then also like how do I do multi uh like multi step proving uh multi step composing effectively Like where I have an intent from A to B You have some something B to C I can collapse it from A to C and then at some point later someone else can come along um to actually finalize this Um And this led into this really interesting third thing which is privacy guarantees Like um  generally like we saw this trend of like everything was going to be zkified and it really means not even on the privacy side but also on the computational compression side that data moves to edge devices So like right Like instead of having this like large data blog in the middle you end up in a world where well all my all our phones kind of like hold a lot of our personal data on them directly and only on demand do we then reveal these if we actually need to coordinate with other people And so intense really fit really well into the zk world where you do proofs over local data Then how do you uh compose composable proof? So I I prove over my local data You prove over your local data Someone else combines this And this is I think also the fundamental unlock um that actually going to happen which is none of the zk tech really works without intents because unless you are willing to tolerate having a single central prover that just does everything for us You need individual self ability to reasonably their own Like to make statements of their on local data And from a practical perspective I was terrified of financial systems that were fully transparent um And I like cash um I'm from Germany Like in Germany the East German Stasi is still a very uh vivid memory uh Having fully transparent government on Fiat payments really seems like a terrible <noise> um So I I think like on a very human level good privacy guarantees are going to just be needed because otherwise the world will look terrifying Yeah Yeah, I think that I think that um you brought up several good points with regards to the state of kind of the transaction based uh paradigm that we're living in right now in crypto which has its certain set of trade-offs But what I'd like to kind of further understand from your perspective to lay the foundation here I think that you guys may have a different definition or at least your own definition of like what intents are with regards to the way that Anoma works maybe you could just illuminate how you're you are thinking about what this intent centric uh paradigm looks like what the and what Anoma's kind of definition of this intent engine really is I think that'll help lay the groundwork for the listeners as as well as for the rest of the conversation"

    "content": "Yeah Let's see um <noise> So intents are just partial state transitions That's at the very simple at the simplest level It's a partial state transition It's like I have some state A and I'd like to be in state B Um and generally in order to settle this someone else needs to be in state B and wants to be in state A You can think of this in a very specific example like a trade I have some ETH and I want to trade for Bitcoin You have some Bitcoin that you wanna trade for ETH Those two are part those two things individually are partial state transitions Once you combine them that forms a transaction that can be settled somewhere Um this of course sort of like extends This is not limited to directly two intents This can be N intents And again two intents can compose into another intent So if I have some ETH for Bitcoin and you have some Bitcoin for SOL for example this intent can be collapsed into ETH for SOL Um and I don't have to care whether there's one other intent a hundred other intents And the other really important thing is so this is all about state layout And really like I know my intents are just about state layout uh like in Anoma in Anoma doesn't really care about like the specific instruction set or the specific message passing model for example Like when you think of the EVM The EVM does three things It does like some sort of state layout It how you access uh contract data It does some instruction set as in like EVM bytecode and it does some message passing model As in like how do other contracts call into other contracts? Like how do contracts call into other contracts right? And so in Anoma intents are just focused on state layout This is the only thing you have to agree on If you agree in the state layout you can use the EVM you can use the SVM I actually don't care Um whatever execution environment you want to use you can do this Um Anoma just really cares about the state layouts here Um and this again can also mean that like an intent can be issued in zero knowledge if you want to So like instead of attaching some like specific data to prove that you So for for example like you own things in some state you own some ETH uh you are free to decide whether you are willing to reveal that you directly own the ETH or you reveal a zk proof that attests to the fact that you own the ETH To the intense this actually is completely transparent Like they don't care This is just like I currently have some state and I'd like to go to some other state and I have an authorization that I am allowed to make this transition Uh Of course the pseudo listeners will sort of realize that how do you get tried intents? Like you need to find a counterparty So if you want to find a counterparty you have to reveal something um but you can be much more pragmatic about this You don't have to yell to the world that you're willing to trade these two assets at that size You can go let me first see who is willing to trade in this range for example And then you can sort of like do much more optional disclosure things um where you reveal less Or if you have if we like the three of us in a room uh we can just reveal to the three of us our intents and then just settle them in zero knowledge fully and not reveal anything else to the world Yeah Yeah I think that's quite important to realize if intents uh The other thing is they're fully programmably programmable So like we getting the same power that we got with Ethereum over Bitcoin sort of like when we moved from Bitcoin to Ethereum We're like holy crap I can like program I'm not limited Bitcoin script And currently like I think everyone is trying to think about intents a little bit more like in comparison like three years ago everyone thought it was crazy um But they're all still thinking on like oh like an intent is a limit order That's just like But that's very limited right? So like in Anoma intents are just programmable Any code you can write it's an intent You wanna do a trade that's dependent on like the US election and the weather in China at the same time Sure If you can write it in code you can execute this kind of intent"
