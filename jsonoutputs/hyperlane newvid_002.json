    "content": "I got a I got a quick question for you so so let let's say I'm you know I'm I uh I'm gonna hop back to the previous slide here so like the the Interchain Security Module let's say you know I'm running my chain you're running your chain and I just wanna be sure like I'm small brain so like my security is like a two-of-two multisig or even a one-of-one multisig right"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "One of one yeah make it the most basic"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Andy",
    "content": "Okay okay and then let's say your chain like you got full on zk aggregation like cryptographic zk proofs magic for your module right and let's say we're connected via Hyperlane is there like is there a weakest link or strongest link type of assurance here between the two because I'm like very clearly using a pretty weak link for my security module yours is much much stronger so does mine get like leveled up to yours does yours get leveled down to okay okay"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "Yeah"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "Let me tell you So the way that it really works is the security module is kind of independent to what happens on that chain and anything that comes out of that chain so like the messages that'll come out of my you know bulletproof zk magic when wherever you accept them on your chain any other chain that wants to accept them it knows it's been secured by the bulletproof thing When I choose to accept yours from your uh I was going to use an unkind word but then I will say"
  },

    "speaker": "Andy",
    "content": "Be"

  {
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "I will say cozy you know how like when you look at apartment listings and it's like it's basically a closet you know that they're masquerading as an apartment they'll call it cozy and charming If I want to receive messages from your chain that has a cozy and charming tiny multisig module I am now accepting those and so you kind of get the benefit of uh when you accept for me you get all the good stuff I get the disadvantage of like if I want to do you know commerce with you if I want to have stuff coming in from your side I can only get the best that you have to offer and in this case unfortunately the best you have to offer is like this cozy presumably insecure uh more fraught with risk setting so that's how it works"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Andy",
    "content": "Got it One of these days we'll level up my apartment to uh to a fully zk magic secure"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "Exactly right That's right and then when you can do that because you're already using Hyperlane basically like that you get you know like okay now I have the magic module it's not like you got to go and restart everything Everything stays the same and now you're basically going oh okay I was using the uh cozy thing and now I get to use the zk magic thing Uh so next up you know this thing I was starting to tell you about earlier Superlane and I would argue that today this is the best you know example the best manifestation of Hyperlane as this open framework for interoperability Now at its core what Superlane really is it is a super chain specific module built to serve you know Superchain member chains And it has distinct validators and is separate from any existing uh Hyperlane module So to start it's going to have uh this grouping of five and then grow the set from there And that set is replicated on all the relevant Superchains that want access to Superlane such that like you know we avoid the case that we just talked about that was actually like a perfect uh you know transition question because what uh Superlane kind of is is instead of me having right like a super beefy setup you having a um more modest setup What Velodrome has done is put together the same setup that we can both use and that way there is no discrepancy when we move between place to place and again because they're all uh Superchain members like the weakest link basically is you either think that like OP stack is battle tested and has the good stuff or that it does not uh and of course I think by now pretty clear that the answer is that um that's pretty good And so you get a replicated trust assumption on all the chains regardless of your starting point Now utilizing this module Velodrome is also going to offer cross-chain swaps between all different Velodrome pools on the different chains that are part of the Superchain Now to be like very clear they could have done that without the Superlane thing They just felt that the best way the most attractive way for them to do that is to combine these two things right so think of like you know Mode Lisk Base World Chain you know uh Unichain when it's live pretty soon Any other Superchain that wants to uh have this type of experience can now get that And you know you're talking about really like a seamless kind of like buttery smooth uh interoperability experience that can come in in lieu of the Superchain native interoperability that we all know is coming And that set of security can continue to grow and I think like really cool um thing that Velodrome's doing here is that they're utilizing their own token to incentivize uh and encourage that security set And so like Superlane's really the first such like distinct uh what I've been calling interop zone that covers a specific ecosystem but I'm damn sure that it won't be the last and like if you ask me what's so cool about these interop zones is well first they can be created by anyone for any ecosystem today right like you don't have to wait Now they can adapt to any security controls that you'd like just kind of like we were talking about before with the the module concept at large So if we stick uh to the Superlane concept but we all know like I was just saying right there is going to be a Superchain native form of interoperability So every Superchain member gets access to this type of experience in the interim once the Superchain native interoperability is live all the apps that use Superlane for their interoperability they can upgrade to the native form of interoperability without having to reinvent anything just going from hey I was pointing at Superlane now I'm going to point at the like Superchain native uh ISM which will use the thing that OP ends up uh releasing and benefit from that uh as the trust assumption for this form of interoperability So you're getting pretty future proof right like you can kind of have your cake and eat it too you get the best interop experience that can be had uh within your ecosystem today and then without any real sacrifice you get the best one tomorrow when is there when it's live And so what I'd say is right if like if you're listening to us right now and you're at zkSync you're at Arbitrum you're any one of the rollup service providers well you can use Hyperlane to create the interop zone and provide that uh silky smooth interop experience that singular trust assumption experience right that's shared across all of the members in your zone for all of your users and you can massively massively shorten your development time by using this open framework and get to market ASAP with the best in class kind of features and really just do it you know in a few weeks versus several months or in some cases even years And you can do this with a framework that is truly open source and best part you never have to talk to anyone who works on Hyperlane as you do so You might want to but you never ever have to"

    "content": "And And Yeah yeah And"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "uh and the last thing on this is of course they can all communicate any one of the chains in your zone can communicate directly with any other chain outside your zone so long as it has Hyperlane even across VM lines and to me that's like what a truly permissionless form of interoperability looks like though of course we would have then what we talked about earlier with like the example between you and me where those zones are not going to likely have like the same trust assumption Got it And and so suppose I say hey John you know that sounds pretty good I I think I'll take that that offer of the best interrupt today and still you know the ability to upgrade when my native solution comes out And and so if I take that offer and I'm in Hyperlane today and then say you know some some time down the and so you know I'm connected today I'm connected in say Superlane and then I'm also via Hyperlane connected to Arbitrum Orbit zkSync and Solana as this diagram shows and then later"
