    "content": "Yeah Yeah Yeah I mean fast withdrawals is a feature that's available for uh chains that use any trust technology Right And it lets you do a withdrawal from safe from an L3 chain down to Arbitrum One in about 15 minutes Um So even though you have a even though optimistic roll-ups have traditionally had a seven-day delay and ZK roll-ups you know hours of delay typically uh to get to finality Um Because without getting too deep into the weeds Because of the way any trust works you have available this option to safely confirm um uh or settle uh L3 uh uh results to L2 much faster Uh and the way that cashes out for users is is this fast withdrawals Uh so that's that's a piece of it But that's 15 minutes right For a user experience standpoint 15 minutes is way better than seven days Right Right Right But you know we we aspire to better than that Right Um You know you want to get to the point where the user doesn't get bored waiting for the for this to happen Right Um and you know it's the question how fast you can make it Can you have you know sub-one-second cross-chain interop That is trustless And doesn't require the chains to be under unified management I think that's possible Um but you know we have some distance to go to get there But that's like for me at least to me that's the goal of interrupt research uh right We don't want to compromise There are sort of these three things right We want independent management we want it to be super fast and cheap and we want it to be trustless right And I don't think that's a trilemma I think you can actually get all three And that you know that is where we are working towards that as as as a space is to Yeah that's where we want to get to But Right you know but we don't know We don't know all the details of how to get there I think I I kind of feel like we can see it from here but we don't know how to get there yeah I feel like that is applicable to a lot of different research areas in crypto today Yeah It feels like it's like just at out of arms length you know It's Yeah yeah getting closer than ever which is is something to be optimistic about Um I also understand that you are maybe as as a contrarian take but maybe not is that you are a bullish L3s Or at least you are extremely interested in the development of L3s where Okay Uh-huh other potentially more monolithic chains will yell at Ethereum in the modular ecosystem as bro do you need more layers L3 L4 L5 L6 Yeah Right So why why are L3s compelling to you and what about Arbitrum makes it a really good home for L3s Yeah Yeah I think there's a couple of reasons why I'm interested in L3s One is the market is interested in L3s right There are a lot of L3s they do a lot of traffic Right L3s do pretty close to half of all the gas all the traffic in the Ethereum stack is is measured by gas Um and that is um right And that's that's a lot right And I that surprised me somewhat I thought we'd see some healthy L3 traffic but not as much as we have So that's one reason right The market seems to want it Um And you can kind of understand why I think if you dig into the details around things like cost of operating a chain Right The big advantage of L3s is that you get to settle to L2 instead of L1 And that helps you two ways One one of your big costs in operating one of these chains is the cost of settlement Which means you're buying gas from your parent chain Yeah Right And you'd much rather buy L2 gas than buy L1 gas Arbitrum One gas is like going to like Thailand and on your Moto versus like your like truck in the states Yeah or like flying first class Yeah On a jet right Yeah Um so that's a big plus And then you know also L2s if you're talking about an L3 on top of Arbitrum One which is like the most popular place for L3s to home Um you know Arbitrum One has features like Stylus that let you do things in say cross-chain bridging or in verifying ZK proofs that you couldn't do on L1 Yeah Um And so for all those reasons you know their advantages to having your parent chain be be Arbitrum One um or in general an L2 Um You know there's some drawbacks to being an L3 as well but I think people find those even must find those advantages compelling Yeah And so I you know I think you know you can ask Will there be an L4 Yeah yeah I don't L3s give you enough throughput though I mean I know L3s give you Yeah I think L3s give you enough and sort of getting off Ethereum which is just a different animal than the L2s uh as your parent chain uh gives you most of that benefit So as we kind of come to a close here Ed Um you you hinted at some of the interrupt research Yeah that you've been doing um What other research has been particularly fascinating to you whether inside of Arbitrum ecosystem or outside Yeah Sure What are you seeing that that that you think has a lot of potential to push the space forward Yeah Um So we've been been we've been focusing a lot on what you can do to make the speed of individual nodes faster Right There's a bunch of ideas out there in the ecosystem Some of them well-formed some of them more uh sort of more nascent um but so we're really looking inside What happens inside a node and how can we make that faster Number one and two make it safe so that uh we don't like you know in the same way that you can't just like increase the gas limit infinitely because uh then nodes can't keep up Right So how can you squeeze more performance out of your chain while still making sure that that that home node operator uh doesn't uh is able to keep up Um and so I think there's a ton of fascinating stuff And as a person who's been interested in computer systems research kind of what's inside the guts of a of the way computers work uh you know for my like my whole career Um I find that really interesting Um So I mean I think that's important Sounds like ZK ZK is also partly there Um I think it's an interesting area Yeah Um I think ZK has value but is overrated in terms of like having a chain use all ZK proving Um because I think uh you know switch if we were to switch from optimistic to ZK I think our users wouldn't even notice Right Except well they wouldn't notice that gas fees were higher Yeah because we had to pay for the cost of proving right So ZK proving your chain doesn't really pay off much in terms of user experience Um that's said but it is on the roadmap in some capacity That is in the roadmap yeah yeah uh because the reason not to do it yet has to do with cost Right Right And so as that cost comes down um then uh you know and we understand how we would or will incorporate ZK proving into the Arbitrum stack But the other interesting thing is ZK proving is not just for like proving all of the computation of your chain It's a really important tool in your toolbox as you're designing protocols And using ZK proving more locally in lots of different places in the protocol I think there's huge advantages there and our team is kind of going going nuts on um identifying opportunities to use ZK to do interesting things Awesome Glad to hear it And Ed thank you for the time I hope you've had a good week so far in in Bangkok It's been great Uh been great to be in Bangkok and Devcon is always a ton a ton of fun A lot of builders no fluff A lot of a lot of builders a lot of fun serious conversations and also just a good time Yeah It's it's the gathering of the tribe Thanks Ed Thanks"
