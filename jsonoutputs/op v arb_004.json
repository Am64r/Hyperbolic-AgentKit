    "content": "And AJ follow up there I and I I like the mental model of of a sov-sovereign wealth fund and a lot of the the ethos behind crypto in general is the separation of money and state And so to think that we can opt into these economic zones at our at our will and not the ones that we were born into geographically is empowering Um Ryan mentioned that the super chain uh uh it has this 15 percent of the sequencer and and the primary reason that that L2s are opting into that uh revenue share program with the super chain is for interop And and the deeper level of interop between the super chain uh roll ups Is is that a similar reason why someone would choose to pay the 10 percent in the Arbitrum ecosystem Is it for a deeper level of interop No it's for something different"

  {
    "speaker": "Guest 1",
    "content": "The way we think about interop is we need to work and build out our interop strategy for the sake of the value proposition of the block space right Because we want people to be just using the Arbitrum technology like I said just expand economic zones of opportunity Right So I'm not trying to sell interop to monetize interop I'm trying to have interop be there to make the product as good as possible so that we can continue to add leverage and people want to use it right So right now like why do people like using the Arbitrum technology They like the stack they like that it's flexible they like that they can do whatever they want with it I would say today and it's a pain point across all of them because none of the interop strategies are live yet The pain point they're like Well the super chain's really public about their interop strategy Right So Arbitrum's probably been less public about it we're probably maybe technically farther behind you know we've definitely been working on some stuff but it's not the primary focus of the business right And I think that's like a really core difference with how we've been evolving the businesses between Arbitrum and Optimism Where Optimism is like this is the way that this is the value proposition we provide right with Arbitrum it's that's just a way for us to meet the product really good so the business can be built on top of it because if we don't innovate at the product level people are not going to be excited about using Arbitrum block space which means we have some fewer economic zones of opportunity etc and obviously it gets small"

    "speaker": "Guest 2",
    "content": "Yeah Thanks for unpacking this guys I think that this is a just really important kind of philosophical differences in in how you both view the world and and how it's evolving AJ I did just want to clarify and touch back on one thing So the 10 percent of chain profit that is for L2s launching using the Orbit stack right"

    "speaker": "Guest 1",
    "content": "Yes"

    "speaker": "Guest 2",
    "content": "That's L3s there's no explicit payment"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Guest 3",
    "content": "Oh L3s are not settling on Arbitral"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Guest 1",
    "content": "Yeah Yeah So if you want to run an L3 on Base then you pay the 10 percent If you want to run an Arbitrum one then you don't pay anything So again like I would say a simple way to like for the audience to understand it is like Arbitrum and Optimism have both have like freemium models right So the OP freemium model would be like OP stack like what Base did"

    "speaker": "Guest 2",
    "content": "Got it Got it"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Guest 1",
    "content": "Yeah and then the premium model where you can get access to all these different things is super chain On Arbitrum um you can launch an L3 and that's free and it's permissionless you can do whatever you want to the code you can launch an L2 and pay the 10 percent Um what I like about our model is that because like the majority of the focus of quote unquote the business I think the value driver back to the Dow is expanding these economic opportunities We're kind of indifferent between the two right"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Guest 2",
    "content": "Yeah"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Guest 1",
    "content": "So like that's I think like a really nice point which is like there's like I don't know hundreds of orbit chains you know supposedly yesterday with an orbit chain that's on base right and like we can like leverage their business and we can help provide value to their business And that's like from our perspective that's great But that's because our business is not sort of tied to restrictive interop model as like the core value prop that we're trying to offer"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Guest 3",
    "content": "And so Yeah I mean you guys don't even really have any L2s do you uh like how many L2s are even using Arbitrum"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Guest 1",
    "content": "Yeah there's a bunch Yeah there's like um I would say that it's probably like a 70 30 split between L3s versus L2s Yeah"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Guest 2",
    "content": "Ryan you all kind of invented I think uh correct me if I'm wrong this idea of chain profit sharing And uh that I think came about with the Base deal Um can you talk us through a little bit what those considerations looked like and what the different knobs were that you all were trying to turn as you negotiated that deal And and the Base deal I think ended up being that they would contribute back two and a half percent of overall chain top-line revenue or 15 percent of net profits to the OP collective And and that is I guess now the the the kind of boiler plate change"

    "content": "Yeah"

    "speaker": "Guest 3",
    "content": "Yeah look you know Base Base was before my time but it was uh you know it was a five-year deal It was the first of its kind to showcase you know horizontal approach you know of getting other people to use OP stack and it was a big shift for Optimism at the time Um you know they're two years into that deal right Uh I think a lot of that that deal we we've structured deals way different now right where you know we want to give some like if you look at Kraken it was like a 25 million OP grant and five million was was upfront And we wanted them to start participating in governance They get tokens They're contributing to the OP stack and so they're like immediately adding value from the protocol and engineering perspective But then there is a lot more now as far as they're opting into their commitments to interop and key handover to the security council and you know it looks way different because you know two years ago we didn't have kind of the vision that we have now of what the super chain looks like and exactly how we want to play out So Base really was a great first mover They've been phenomenal like the contributions they've made to the OP stack have been amazing The value that they brought you know I think if you look at their sequencer revenue it's probably 10 to 15 million in USD that they generated an E relative to the deal That's like not like how you would look at that deal the very like Web2 way of looking at the you know the actual the deal The the ecosystem effects the broad value that they have created for for Optimism ecosystem and the collective um the partners that have knocked on the door because they want to be in the same cohort as Base Um it's really hard to like totally quantify the incredible value that they brought in the Optimism ecosystem And I think there's like a and they've been I think you know even even Jesse would admit like they've been wildly successful beyond what they would have ever thought in their first 12 months Maybe he wouldn't say it though because he's very you know he's very impressive Um So yeah it's been great right Like it's been great We learned a lot There's things you know I think both sides of that if we could go back two years ago I think both sides probably would have done different you know made different changes to that deal But that's okay that's like part of the exploration of this space And we have a good relationship with them and uh they've been fun to like really fun and collaborative and helpful And I think Jesse's been a great you know a great messenger of the super chain messaging and what it stands for And Hayden has been now as well with Uni So like going over to you know Uni I think really gets this application interrupt You know I mean Uni moving from let's deploy everywhere to like let's have a chain and how do we bring liquidity into that chain It's going to be really exciting and and excited for their launch that's coming up soon So yeah it's it's that um you know it's set the tone for the direction that we've been going and uh it's been it's been fun to work with them"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Guest 2",
    "content": "Yeah thanks for sharing And um yeah again I think that in many ways that deal uh you must have had to draw inspiration from other models of negotiations etcetera because it's quite rare I think to see these types of deals being struck in Web3 where everything is just so open composable free open source We'll figure out business model later but I give you guys a lot of credit for doing the hard work of probably slogging through a bunch of different approaches and and coming to one that um clearly is working and and is net positive for both"

    "speaker": "Guest 3",
    "content": "Look like even people like Proto contributed you know to like you know uh you know reducing like we basically contributed to reducing sequencer fees Right like our our team helps to do that So like we even did that knowing that was like"

  {
    "speaker": "Guest 3",
    "content": "Yeah which was crazy right Like it's it's great You know so like we did that even if it went against that like the short-term business model right now that we're leaning in It's like sequencer revenue It's like but that there are things that we want to do for the greater good of Ethereum And I know we need to get to talking about Ethereum alignment But like definitely Arbitrum and Optimism for any differences we have we are all in on Ethereum and making it better and like coming together which has been awesome And so yeah we're going to have to keep iterating You know what worked 12 months ago isn't going to work 12 months from now and like we're going to keep we're going to keep it moving"

    "speaker": "Guest 2",
    "content": "What would you each say to the folks who are saying that oh you know all of these L2s uh what Optimism's doing what Arbitrum's doing It's it's parasitic to the L1 It's not Ethereum You know they're trying to build their own kingdoms and and uh take away from Ethereum What what's your response to that"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Guest 1",
    "content": "Um well first I I think that like um I think what people do are they're conflating two things One is and you know I I actually don't think it's the right decision"
