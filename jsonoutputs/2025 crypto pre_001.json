    "content": "arrives most AGI is not going to be sovereign meaning that it's not going to have the ability to actually control itself to control its own existence to pay for its own servers to to you know decide for itself what it wants to do there will be Sovereign AIs but there'll probably be very few of them you know they'll they'll be you know you can imagine already how would a Sovereign AI work Well you know it might own some crypto that maybe it hacked from somebody or got as a donation and that's how it gets some startup capital it used that to pay for its own GPUs on you know Akash or Render or Ionet um and then it you know starts hiring other agents to do other work for it to help it give it more training data so they can learn more and get smarter so this is what a Sovereign AI might do it might you know work for money it might steal for money who knows what what it might do in order to keep itself running but I think these are actually going to be pretty far in few between uh now why is that one reason of course is that uh if you're a Sovereign AI you can you can rent GPUs on Akash and on Ionet but you can't get any of the GPUs on AWS right they're they're not for you if you if you go set up an AWS account you're like hey I'm a Sovereign AI they'll be like uh yeah we don't want to serve you fuck off and they'll like steal all your money um and so the reality is that most of the resources on Earth are going to be we we're going to be very actively discriminating against AIs um to say you know one because we like humans right unsurprisingly um like you might think like well you know uh once the AIs are better than us clearly they're going to earn more resources right um a good analogy that I heard somebody make recently is that you know if you think about it like why aren't chess AIs winning all the chess tournament money The answer is because we don't let them right we don't let them in the tournaments uh because it's like well the tournament is kind of less fun if we let the AIs play on an even playing field than us now we're happy to use the chess AIs to let the humans get better right and so I think what you're going to see is these very intentional kind of market structures set up to allow AIs to to be useful to us in the ways that we we can allow them um but a lot of the source of capital you know like where is most of the money sitting most of the money is sitting in treasuries and at you know the stock market and and a lot of places where if you're an AI you you're not allowed to play um you're not allowed to hold stocks you're not allowed to you know do any of these things now crypto is going to be one of these permissionless layers where AIs can basically do whatever the fuck they want because in crypto you don't need to ask anybody for permission as long as you can custody a private key you get to do everything that I get to do um and so in a way it was almost designed for machines more so than it was designed for humans um that I think is is captivating for crypto but I I don't think it implies that oh okay well now the AIs are going to supersede us and their economy is going to eclipse our economy I think it's very likely that we are going to for a long time not necessarily forever but for a long time uh we're going to bend the AIs to our will and only let them play in the parts of the economy that we cordon off for them"

    "content": "And I think on the Sovereign part specifically one one project and kind of example that you made in your talk was Fraysa I think um which has obviously all those AI coins have been doing extremely well speculations High but that's like one of the ones that you know is actually somewhat Sovereign a lot of these current AI agent projects are literally just like Dev behind agent and like kind of set out free in the wild but also like not exactly um and I know I remember truth terminal made a a typo or like a spelling error and that's when the whole Market kind of came to realize like oh shit this isn't exactly uh you know an LLM behind this thing only it's not exactly a sovereign agent happening"

    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "Yeah"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "Well so hold on let me let me distinguish uh because there's three categories three categories of AIs that I that I described here so the first category is a truly Sovereign AI Now truly Sovereign AI doesn't just mean that it's it's autonomous Sovereign means that nobody controls it literally it is in control of itself it has its own money it has its own longevity and it also means that nobody can turn it off So even if you're like this AI is evil it's scamming people it's doing terrible things we should get rid of it too bad you can't stop it it is an unstoppable AI that's a Sovereign AI"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "Yeah so you can imagine a human decides to create a Sovereign AI just like as a fuck you to the world or just as a cool experiment um but you can also imagine an AI goes Rogue and sort of decides to deploy a version of itself in a Sovereign manner as just like a you know kind of escape pod that escapes the control of its owner and its own you know AWS box or whatever it's"

    "speaker": "Rob",

    "speaker": "Andy",
    "content": "Just uh last thing before we get to the"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "Uh I mean it's it's in principle it's possible today is an AI coherent enough to be able to make long-term plans to like make money and buy compute and like do all this stuff not really not really like an AI would just end up in an infinite loop and run out of money and do stupid things right because right now most of these AI agents if you really run them on their own they're kind of like Roombas"

    "speaker": "Andy",
    "content": "Yeah they hallucinate a lot"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "They look pretty good for while they're doing most of the floor yeah they hallucinate they get stuck in loops they just like do stupid stuff um so no if you if you look at for example uh did you guys see that demo that Cloud released of an AI using a computer and like you know they try to get it to like book a flight and booking a flight it's a pretty linear process to book a flight and it could book a flight maybe like 20 30 of the time we're just like okay what is it doing the other 70 of the time and the answer I can't tell you"

    "speaker": "Guest",

  {
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "Right Yeah exactly exactly so so um so the reality is like they can't do it yet"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Andy",
    "content": "Sure"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "content": "Yes okay so so type one is fully Sovereign AI that's like the end state that's like crazy sci-fi land uh that's where you you got you got robbed by a Sovereign agent you know like that's that's that's uh sci-fi land okay we're not there yet second is a fully autonomous AI now fully autonomous doesn't mean that it pays for itself and owns itself right an autonomous AI might be one that's run by somebody but they have no intervention directly into the code right so they're running it on their AWS box they're running it on their machine but they can't just go change the weights they can't edit the replies they can't you know be like oh I'm going to fix your punctuation or I'm going to make you shill this token you didn't want to shill um all they all they can do is actually just run its weights and do inference according to the way that it was trained so that's Fraysa Fraysa is an autonomous AI in that uh the Dev could not change what Fraysa is doing right or if you run an AI inside of a trusted execution environment or a trusted Hardware that's that's going to be an autonomous AI nobody can change it or interact with it then you have uh one level below that which is what I call Wizard of Oz AIs So Wizard of Oz AI is that it looks like an AI from the outside but on the inside there's a little dude yeah like exactly controlling the levers uh now there's different ways to do a Wizard of Oz AI one Wizard of Oz AI is literally there's an AI somewhere but whenever the dude wants to he just goes in and replies on behalf um another version of a Wizard of Oz AI is that somebody is basically filtering the responses from the AI to prevent it from saying something stupid or doing something stupid right so this would be for example let's say you know mostly I'm letting the AI talk but sometimes the AI might say something racist or it might like talk shit about its own token and I don't want it to do that or it's getting jailbroken somebody has a jailbreak and convinced it to like send all the money to them and I'm like okay don't do that you know I'm gonna I'm going to prevent it from doing something stupid so most almost all of these AI agents right now that you see on Twitter uh they are either one they have no money so they have no autonomy or two if they actually have money and they have some degree of autonomy they're Wizard of Oz AIs so somebody's in there preventing it from doing anything stupid now the guy who created Truth terminal he admitted that it was a Wizard of Oz AI in the sense that he was filtering the responses to make sure because you know it look it's talking about goatsy if it's talking about goatsy it's probably also talking about a bunch of other vile shit that he probably doesn't want getting tweeted right and so he he was explicit like look I trained this on like random 4chan garbage so of course I'm not going to be letting it say everything that comes to its mind"

    "content": "And we actually think about doing a which I think every company in crypto should be doing this so hopefully I'm not leaking the alpha too early although it's obviously clearly already out there which is we're going to make a roll up agent it'll likely be a Wizard of Oz we're gonna work uh we haven't signed anything yet so we'll keep it under wraps for for now as far as like the partnerships and stuff but we're going to work with a pretty Nice solid team to basically get this agent out in the wild probably a Wizard of Oz agent but with with capabilities such that they can actually edit some of our content they can actually post insights from the content they can make second and third order uh kind of like at least some sort of second and third order insights from the actual posts they can summarize it they can engage with our community um and hopefully they can have a wallet as well and we can kind of try to get this thing uh uh also to be kind of like making money and and so that'll be a fun experiment and I think you know I think Dragonfly should do it I think all media companies I think every single typically because ultimately all these crypto companies today they're all media companies they're all attention companies in their own right so if if if an agent can help you with your community I think it has to be a Wizard of Oz to start agent but you know I think I think it's it's a really good idea and so um you know I'd be keen to see how how the roll-up agent would interact with Dragonfly's agents and be like yo drag Dragonfly you guys invested in ritual right well here's our podcast with you know Saniel and Ilya who's who's an advisor check it out you know we talked about how we think how Robbie's 2025 prediction from yesterday is that he thinks that more transactions on chain will be done by agents than humans and so you know yeah and then Dragonfly's agent is like oh maybe here's the numbers and then so anyway just kind of like imagining things here but I think this uh this trend will accelerate"
