    "content": "kind of like in an abstract sense here is perhaps within a cluster of roll ups you have a way of defining like your local IP address and you have a way of handling local device-to-device communication and then what IBC can do from a perspective is offer like a public IP address where this is much more commonly understood as a community across ecosystems I think obviously has a lot a lot of value in cross cluster communication um and maybe over time when like folks don't want to maintain the wrong networking standard they'll even adopt this wide area networking protocol virtual wide area networking protocol for the local cluster communication as well um but that's going to take a lot of time I don't think it's going to happen overnight I think it took over 20 years or mini decades for systems to gradually transition over and even then like simply protocol like even Apple talk people had their own networking standard that took until like the 2000s to be deprecated so uh this is going to be a lot of overlap in in these protocols and and the no no make a good point on atomic composability uh to me I I find atomic composability having a lot of value in um in in the roll up setting or just in in in any setting when you have applications that will benefit from close proximity and execution uh and then the the mental model that I have for this I I I know I don't remember I think I was on a panel before I might I might have mentioned this but this concept of for like Wall Street today and when I think about Wall Street today you have companies that pay for like proximity execution proximity to where the value is being created like these exchanges so like I'm going to pay millions of dollars more than my competitor because I'm going to I want my server blade to be in the same rack as your server blade um the closer I can get my rack to yours I can be like like a a hair length of a like a fraction of a second faster a and and be able to benefit from extracting more value or like um arbitrage to be a little more efficient than my competitors so I think you start to see it anyways with like how people price blocks if there's a lot of liquidations happening the price of a block will be bid up um if there's nothing happening at all then the price of a block just comes down and and to no this point I think uh the the densest the densest areas of economic activity would attract additional folks to to come in so that to me it's like a snowball thing where like there's some like minimal minimal viable defi that needs to be uh within a certain block space and now that that and now atomic composability with that block space becomes that much more interesting and like until you get over like minimum value defi atomic composability doesn't matter uh as much and then I think in the long tail of applications atomic composability might not be as important for like things that are lower value with there's not as much value to to to track like just like gaming or like social media or or stuff that just doesn't uh benefit from from that type of composability"

    "content": "Yeah I think that you touch on a great point there where I do think you will see people wanting to be like as fast as possible within kind of this like minimal viable defi ecosystem and do you think like cross ecosystem communications is going to be interesting to see kind of how it plays off of all these different clusters 'cause at least something we've seen in kind of developing Javelin as well as like our other products at Nodecet um is we've seen that like the most value for people that are within our ecosystem has been when we have other products that are similar to them or complementary to them and they can work together and I think that's where you get a lot of the value I don't necessarily think that you're going to have like a defi chain communicate uh uh a gaming chain if in a single block and that's not necessarily going to provide as much value but if I'm a gaming studio for example like Ubisoft that's going to be extremely valuable for me if I can communicate across all my different games very quickly because games particularly they just want to have a better UX 'cause most of their users aren't knowing that it's crypto but I believe Andy you tweeted about this recently isn't it like 250 second milli 250 millisecond interrupt wasn't that what you were tweeting about lately I've been catching up on that"

    "speaker": "Andy",
    "content": "Yeah I mean that's been my idea like so two things there and I I'll kind of hit on that and then I wanna kind of just come to a consensus on what we're thinking about the key priorities are for intra cluster kind of inter-rollup and then inter but like my vision is like okay if we can have this idea of of like sub 200 really sub 200 millisecond inter up between um any chain you know I I think that's like good enough for now to at least give an experience such that I can have like you know a a universal account or a creditable account a smart contract wallet that is accessible across all roll-ups app chains L2s doesn't really matter as long as they're basically EVM roll up or ZK EVM etcetera and then eventually hopefully kind of like other execution environments as well but that kind of is a different conversation I think within the EVM 200 millisecond kind of asynchronous interoperability on the back end and then on on the front end it's kind of like chain abstracted experience is like that would take us from where we are right now which is like Ethereum is completely fragmented and isn't composable to like okay Ethereum feels like Ethereum in early 2020 again so that's like my my like minimal viable like that's where we need to like push for but I understand like these kind of asynchronous composability and these different solutions are even a step further than that but I also am kind of attributing those to be a little bit more uh in their or earlier in their development cycle"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Bo",
    "content": "Yeah I I can share some uh thoughts around like maybe taking a step back from the technical details from a product perspective like what does a user expect I think if we're just strictly talking about defi and value transfer 250 milliseconds is like fast enough for for most people um but if you say talk about other types applications I know this is a little bit more forward looking these kind of applications don't exist in in kind of today's world imagine using a game uh if you like need to make like make a micro transaction you want to pay using a credit card to purchase something in the game maybe you're like okay waiting like a few hundred milliseconds but when you're committing game actions and your character is like doing certain things if you're doing like a FPS 250 milliseconds between when you click a button and someone gets shot is probably not okay you're you're going to lose um that's that's a really bad ping um so I I think to know this point about like what can be what can be co-located what's interesting like a game studio would want like maybe all of their gaming related things that require like fast interactions maybe to be atomically composable with with each other and create like a a cluster and then outside of that cluster there may be like like a payments let's say this maybe the the have the user has their actual funds on a different chain uh maybe there is uh an NFT marketplace for the in-game items that can also be a separate thing and now you have this like ecosystem of an application that's also like spread over different uh parts of the uh blockchain literally different block space that and that block space itself has different properties"

    "speaker": "Noah",
    "content": "Yeah I tend to agree on that I think that over time we're we're going to see this rise of like really application specific and like use case specific like having a chain and internally we've kind of called it is like a bank chain or like a um a hub chain where users leave their money on it and exchanges onboard those chains but if we think there's going to be hundreds potentially thousands of chains in the future I don't think you're going to have Binance or Coinbase or any of these large um centralized entities onboard every single one of these chains that's why I do believe that like having extremely fast composability between these different chains will allow people to kind of string together these different actions they previously could only uh string together on a single singular chain so you can onboard quicker you build a better experience for example if you're building a consumer fintech app you want to potentially be able to get USDC yield in your app via treasury bills but if you have your own app chain you might get siloed away and then a TVL RTB TBIL product might not want to deploy to your own consumer app chain so being able to have an RTB chain where you are able to unlock TBIL yields and have your user funds be able to get deposited in there while keeping them in your same user experience I think it's really important I think this idea of like users will know every single chain I don't necessarily think users will know every single chain and I do think we'll see a rise of like utility first chains that developers know but users don't necessarily need to know because users don't know every single piece of software that they use in the day-to-day like Zoom could use a completely different video processing software under the hood and none of us would really notice um that much of a difference unless it was worse or better we just notice well Zoom is working as intended I think this idea of everything is known in crypto so every single person every single part of the stack is something that's like slightly holding us back a bit because I think applications are the sum of their parts they aren't the parts themselves and I think that by enabling better applications that's where we're going to see the real like leaps and bounds thing in crypto because right now when you try and onboard something that's not in crypto to like an app chain or even just onboard them into a chain that's not like a Ethereum or Solana I think that user experience can really suffer and I think that making that user experience better um by being able to like have these faster actions across chains I think will really help with like this modular future of actually like proliferating rather than I think I think the biggest failure of the modular ecosystem could be if it's only us four um on this live stream that actually all understand how it works I I would view that as a failure of the So"
